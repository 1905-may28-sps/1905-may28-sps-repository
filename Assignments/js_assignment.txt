Javascript Homework
Due Tuesday 6/9 -- to be pushed by 9AM in your branch

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create an HTML file that takes in input and carries out at least 10
of the following functions and manipulates the DOM to show the outcome.
Please put the question itself as a comment above each answer.
Use either JavaScript, jQuery, or both (but know the difference!).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Fibonacci 
Define function: fib(n) 
Return the nth number in the fibonacci sequence.

2. Bubble Sort
Define function: bubbleSort(numArray)
Use the bubble sort algorithm to sort the array.
Return the sorted array.

3. Reverse String
Define function: reverseStr(someStr)
Reverse and return the String.

4. Factorial
Define function: factorial(someNum)
Use recursion to compute and return the factorial of someNum.

5. Substring
Define function substring(someStr, length, offset)
Return the substring contained between offset and (offset + length) inclusively.
If incorrect input is entered, use the alert function and describe why the input was incorrect.

6. Even Number
Define function: isEven(someNum)
Return true if even, false if odd.
Do not use % operator.

7. Palindrome
Define function isPalindrome(someStr)
Return true if someStr is a palindrome, otherwise return false

8. Shapes
Define function: printShape(shape, height, character)
shape is a String and is either "Square", "Triangle", "Diamond".
height is a Number and is the height of the shape. Assume the number is odd.
character is a String that represents the contents of the shape. Assume this String contains just one character.
Use a switch statement to determine which shape was passed in.
Use the console.log function to print the desired shape.
Example for printShape("Square", 3, "%");
%%%
%%%
%%%
Example for printShape("Triangle", 3, "$");
$
$$
$$$
Example for printShape("Diamond", 5, "*");

9. Object literal
Define function traverseObject(someObj)
Print every property and it's value.

10. Delete Element
Define function deleteElement(someArr)
Print length
Delete the third element in the array.
Print length
The lengths should be the same.

11. Splice Element
Define function spliceElement(someArr)
Print length
Splice the third element in the array.
Print length
The lengths should be one less than the original length.

12. Defining an object using a constructor
Define a function Person(name, age)
The following line should set a Person object to the variable john:
	var john = new Person("John", 30);

13. Defining an object using an object literal
Define function getPerson(name, age)
The following line should set a Person object to the variable john:
	var john = getPerson("John", 30);
 
14. Display the current time on the top right of your HTML page, 
updating every second

15.  Descending order
Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative 
integer as a argument and return it with its digits in descending 
order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.
