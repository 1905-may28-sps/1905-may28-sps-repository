	/*
	 * Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an
	 * element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.
	 * There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different
	 * ways.
	 * 
	 * Always pick first element as pivot. Always pick last element as pivot
	 * (implemented below) Pick a random element as pivot. Pick median as pivot. The
	 * key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of partitions is, given an
	 * array and an element x of array as pivot, put x at its correct position in
	 * sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put
	 * all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in
	 * linear time.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Pseudocode: 
	 * quickSort(arr[], low, high) { 
	 * 		if (low < high) { 
	 * 			// pi is partitioning index, arr[pi] is now at right place 
	 * 			pi = partition(arr, low, high);
	 * 
	 * 			quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1); // Before pi 
	 * 			quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);// After pi
	 * 		 } 
	 *  }
