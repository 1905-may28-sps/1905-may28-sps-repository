public class LeftRotation {

	/*
	 * A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements unit to the left. For example, if  left rotations are performed on array ,[1,2,3,4,5] then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].

Given an array  of  integers and a number, , perform  left rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

Function Description

Complete the function rotLeft in the editor below. It should return the resulting array of integers.

rotLeft has the following parameter(s):

An array of integers .
An integer , the number of rotations.
Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers  and , the size of  and the number of left rotations you must perform.
The second line contains  space-separated integers .

Constraints

Output Format

Print a single line of  space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing  left rotations.

Sample Input

5 4
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output

5 1 2 3 4

Explanation

When we perform  4 left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:

[1,2,3,4,5] -> [2,3,4,5,1] ->[3,4,5,1,2] -> [4,5,1,2,3] -> [5,1,2,3,4]
	 */
}
