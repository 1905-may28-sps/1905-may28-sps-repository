    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Fish Keeping 101</h1>
    <p>So to end all this please make sure to keep up with all the maintenance, do not forget to feed the fish, and if
        you bought a common pleco be prepared to buy a bigger fish tank in the near future.
        Pleco's grow very large and fast, just a warning.
        Also do not forget to always be careful of what fish you are adding into the this tank or
        future tanks. Always do your research before adding any fish together. For example if you put a goldfish in a
        tank with a male Betta fish,
        the Betta will kill the goldfish. Another bad choice would be to put shrimp into a tank with carnivorous fish or fish that will eat them like pleco's. Also 
        please do not forget to keep the fish in plenty of space. All these rules should help you avoid deaths and heart aches. So you can 
        name your fish and not have to worry of them dying days later.
    </p>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">You're Welcome</h1>
