    <h2 style="text-align: center">This is a step by step process on how to get an aquarium running and you having a
        proper, healthy community of fish. If followed properly will result in almost no fish deaths unlike a certain
        developer I happen to be well aquainted with that has flushed
        quite a few fish down the toilet... </h2>
    <h1 style="text-align: center">The secret to keeping Fish alive, healthy and your hobby flourishing</h1>
    <p><strong>Fish</strong> make for interesting pets and believe it or not they happen to have different personalities
        and behave in different styles depending on breeds and types of fish. Not all fish are the same and
        they all make up the fish world. When a person thinks about fish they do not usually understand the
        complexity that makes up the whole family of fish. For example what happens when you put into an aquarium a
        Betta
        fish that happens to be male with any other kind of fish with beautiful colors and patterns including and
        especially another male Betta?
