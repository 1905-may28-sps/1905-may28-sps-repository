    <h2 style="text-align:center">Now to enlighten you a bit, just follow these instructions step by step
        and do not skip any step please or its kaput!
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Buy your fish tank, I suggest you buy a ten gallon tank to start.</li>
            <li>Make sure that the
                tank is washed with some warm to hot water and no chemicals AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Buy a 10 to 20 gallon filter preferably aqueon because it is a great brand. </li>
            <li>Wash the filter cartidges with warm to hot water and no chemicals then place them into the filter</li>
            <li>Buy a light for your fish, you will keep it on for 12 hours and have it off the same amount of
                time.(mimics life...sort of)</li>
            <li>Make sure the place you are placing your tank at is not in direct sunlight unless you want a <a
                    href="https://www.livescience.com/54979-what-are-algae.html">green</a>
                tank(science google it)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Buy some pebbles or go get them for free at the river.... wash them thoroughly (no chemicals)</li>
            <li>Buy some plants preferably amazon sword plants(wash them), so your fish can hide and the plants help
                keep your water clean naturally(that is a science google it)</li>
            <li>buy some drift wood or go find it at the river... just wash it thoroughly and let it sit in the sun
                before inserting in water.(For a pleco if wanted)</li>
            <li>Go get like 5 hand sized rocks for decoration and for the fish, I had my little bro pick some up for me
                at the park...Just wash it and let it sit in the sun</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Now you pour in water that has been mixed with <a

                until it is at the edge or less and obviously dont overfill it until it comes out...</li>

            <li>Now you will buy a <a
                    href="https://www.petsmart.com/fish/food-and-care/water-care-and-conditioning/top-fin-bacteria-supplement-aquarium-cycling-water-conditioner-5112325.html">aqueon
                    beneficial bacteria </a> starter and pour it in as per instructions on bottle</li>
            <li>Next let it sit for some time until the bacteria does its thing and creates your ecosystem, I would wait
                2 weeks at least.</li>
            <li>Check your water with a test kit and make sure everything is ay okay...</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If your water passed step three now we can go fish shopping.</li>
            <li>Here is a simple fish tank set up for you ten gallon tank.</li>
            <ol>
                <li> One Betta Fish, for beautiful display</li>
                <li>5-6 neon tetras or black neon tetras(they are schooling fish, again google it)</li>
                <li>3 Cory catfish(they also school in groups of 3)</li>
                <li> One snail</li>
                <li>You can get a common pleco if you like but make sure to not get the catfish if the pleco is wanted
                </li>
            </ol>
            <li>The reason for not buying the three catfish if the pleco is bought is because space is becoming tight.
            </li>
            <li>There is this rule that is commonly known as the 1 inch of fish per gallon rule to give you a guide.
            </li>
            <li>If the rule is not followed there might arise issues with fish fighting over space because there is not
                enough of it.</li>
            <li>The betta takes the top portion of your tank, the tetras take your middle section of your tank, and the
                catfish/pleco takes the bottom along with the snail.
                This will insure that the fish all have a piece of the tank and will live peacefully, unless you have a
                super aggressive Betta.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Step 5</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Now when bringing the fish you have selected home make sure that you let the bag with the fish sit in
                the water literally </li>
            <li>Do not pour the fish in with the water from inside the bag, you do not want this water, it is bad.</li>
            <li>I would buy a small net and use that to pick the fish out of the bag and place it into the tank.One by
                One.</li>
            <li>Next pour out the dirty water from the bags into the toilet and place them in the garbage please.</li>
            <li>Finally enjoy and dont forget to feed your fish once a day, usually in the mornings with a pinch of
                pellets, a smaller pinch of flakes for the Betta and some algea chips for the bottom dwellers</li>
            <li>Yes and clean your fish tank once a week with a vacuum that you can buy at petco or petsmart, make sure
                to dig into the gravel with the vacuum or you are doing nothing. Literally slowly go through the gravel
                and keep your vacuum on the glass of the tank the whole time. You do not remove your fish, just leave
                them in there and do not kill them. Also remove any decoration and place it back in afterwards. Make
                sure to only remove with the vacuum around fifty percent maximum of the water. If the tank
                water is dirtier then remove a bit more. Just do not go past the forty percent mark of the tank.
            </li>
            <li>The filter cartidges are changed when you see water coming out of the filters sides, which means nothing
                can permeate the filter cartridge itself. One small trick I have learned is wash the cartridge in the
                dirty water removed from the fish tank amd squeeze the
                cartridge until the cartidge is not full of stuff anymore and place it back into the filter. Make sure
                you do not do this with clean tap water. Cartridges Usually last me a couple of months thanks to doing
                that. Which in turn have saved money on buying new cartridges.
            </li>
            <li>If you live in a cold place or a place that can get cold make sure you buy a heater from petco or
                petsmart as well for the aquarium, and a thermometer. Try to keep you water temperature around 75 to 80
                degrees for healthy fish.</li>
        </ul>
