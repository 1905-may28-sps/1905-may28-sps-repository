/*
JavaScript is a scripting language used for 
client side operations

Do note, however, that there are many frameworks 
that allow the server-side use of JS. It's known 
as a client-side language because it can be 
interpreted from the browser

- loosely typed  - we do not declare variable types, 
  they are dynamically allocated based on the assignment
  of the varable. We declare variables with one of 
  the three keywords
  - let - allows for block scope
  - var - does not distinguish between block and function scope
  - const - does not allow vars to be reassigned
- var scopes 
  - global - accessible throughout the entirety of the script
  and through the console in the browser. Globally scoped
  variables are declared outside of any function or block
  OR they have just never been declared and their declaration
  is "hoisted" to the top of the page, making them global
  - function 
  - block - only with the use of let or const 
- datatypes include number, string, boolean, objects, 
  undefined, NaN (debatable bc typeOf(NaN) = number)
- if..else, returns, switch, try..catch, do..while, 
for, breaks, continue, while 
- TRUTHY AND FALSY
    - because JS is loosely typed, we have to be able to 
    assign everything a true or false identity so that they 
    can be evaluated as conditions in control statements 
    - FALSY - false, null, 0, undefined, NaN, ""
    - TRUTHY - everything else 
- Type coersion - the process that JS takes to bring data
from one type to another to compare the actual value as opposed 
to the datatype
