# JSON - JavaScript Object Notation 

A data interchange format that is both human readable and easily parsed by comptuers. JSON is NOT the same thing as a JavaScript object, but is formated similarly to JS objects 

JS object:
```javascript

    var obj = {
        id: 1,
        name: 'myObject',
        biography: 'This is a JavaScript object'
    };

``` 

JSON string __representing__ this object:

```javascript
{
    "id" : 1,
    "name" : "myObject",
    "biography" : "This is a JavaScript object"
}
```
