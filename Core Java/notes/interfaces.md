# Interfaces
* special types of classes
* cannot be instantiated
* cannot have concrete methods
* all methods are implicitly `public abstract`
* all variables are implicitly `public static final`
* all implementing classes must implement all abstract methods
  * same is true if a parent abstract class has abstract methods


```
public interface Shape {
  void calculateArea();
}
```

# Abstract classes vs Interfaces
* when would you use one or the other?
