# Wrapper Classes
* A class that represents a primitive
* Useful because some Java features do not allow primitives
  * Generics
  * Collections
* Notice **int** and **Integer**
* Notice **char** and **Character**
* The rest are the same name as the primitive but with a capital first letter
* All classes are immutable
