	 * When we need to execute a set of statements based 
	 * on a condition then we need to use control flow 
	 * statements. For example, if a number is greater than 
	 * zero then we want to print “Positive Number” but if 
	 * it is less than zero then we want to print “Negative 
	 * Number”. In this case we have two print statements in 
	 * the program, but only one print statement executes at 
	 * a time based on the input value. We will see how to 
	 * write such type of conditions in the java program 
	 * using control statements.
	 * 
	 * Assignment: With a partner, 
	 * go through the control statements tab in this site
	 * https://beginnersbook.com/2017/08/if-else-statement-in-java/ 
	 * and code one example of each of the following:
	 * if statement, nested if statement, if-else statement, 
	 * if-else if- else statement, for loop, for each loop,
	 * while loop, do while loop, and switch statement
	 *
