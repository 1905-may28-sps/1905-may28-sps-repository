        <h1>You Too Can Be An Artist</h1>
    <p><b>Art</b> can be defined in many ways depending on who you ask. For many art is something to look at and something to create. For some, including me, it can be both!

                <p>On the right are pictures of mountains created using different mediums; there is also one wild card. You may or may not prefer a certain image. I have experience using all the mediums shown (although what I create definitely pales in comparision). If you don't have a prefrence maybe you should start with the first image. This is made with a medium I am currently working with. You could also choose the second image, as I have an interesting story to share with you regarding that medium. Unfortunately, I don't have much to say about the final image but it was an important part of my childhood growing up.  </p>

                <td><p>"Watercolor painting is the process of painting with pigments that are mixed with water. Of all the painting processes, watercolor painting is known for its inherent delicacy and subtlety because watercolor art is all about thin washes and transparent color (though watercolors can be made opaque with the addition of Chinese white). Traditionally, watercolor artists work on paper, though the tooth of the surface can vary greatly. Oftentimes the white of the painting surface will gleam through and lend itself to the luminosity of the painting."

                <div>Some dificulties I've had with watercolors is getting a bright color with out oversaturating the page. Sometimes I apply multiple layers but the paper winds upiling.  </div></p>

                <td><b>Acrylic</b></td>
                <td><p>"Compared to oil and watercolor, acrylic painting is a relatively modern medium for artistic expression. Many artists are attracted to acrylic painting for its dominant bright colors and sharp brushstrokes and lines, as well as for the paintâ€™s capacity to be used on a variety of surfaces and mixed with a multitude of other media. All in all, acrylic painting offers the artist a wide range of approaches, providing a wealth of creative potential for artistic innovation and fresh new ideas. Here is the story of the cultivation of acrylic painting as an artistic medium over the course of the 20th century."
                   <div> While on vaction with my friends we decided to paint the sunset at a historic landmark. It was really fun overall but it got better when I sold my painting!</div>

Photographers since the birth of the medium have explored wild lands for art as well as science. Much has changed in a century and a half, yet surprising similarities remain between the first landscape masters and those working today."
                    <div>I like many mainly take photos from my phone, but my middle school had a really great arts program. as part ofa project we had a photography course where took black and white pictures near our school and around Manhattan.</div></p>
